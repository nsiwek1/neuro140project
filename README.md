# neuro140project
project for neuro 140 (human & artificial intelligence) - generazability of x-ray datasets in medical context


## repo structure
I used the Jupyter Notebook for most of my project but as i was reusing certain cells multiple times/with checking different versions of code
Due to that the .ipynb files are not cleaned up, but they still show most of the results used in the paper. The .py files have cleaned version of code that should be better to read through
